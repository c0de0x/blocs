Blocs - Building trust in blockchains
=====================================

We create transparency for a global economy built on blockchains and blocs. It is the only decentralized solution in the market

As the blockchain analysis community with POS technology. Our mission is to build trust in blockchains and for us that begins with transparency. Through POS technology every time a Masternodes is installed, it creates a point that automatically collects information through ML tools in all internet space about blockchain. This information will be stored and an explorer will be created to have quality information about the blockchain. We are the world's first POS system with its own decentralized browser to store information only about blockchain.
