Dexirgi implemented an advanced version of the “Zerocoin Protocol”, that gives Bitstats  users the option of making completely anonymous transactions. 
The Bitstats token is a global adoption currency for transparent accounting and helps charities of corporations, medium, small and autonomous companies.
In the Bitcoin network, transactions require 10 minutes for confirmation! For a business, this is unacceptable. Bitstats transactions, on the other hand, are confirmed within 60 seconds and are most often instant.
Currently, the fee to send a $25 Bitcoin transaction, e.g. to pay for a decent meal, is $0.42. The same transaction, paid with BITSTATS, would cost less than $0.01. i.e. It’d almost be free!
